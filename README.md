# DocMaster
DocMaster is a unified platform designed for annotating PDF documents, model training, and inference, tailored for document question-answering. Importantly, as annotations, training, and inference occur on-device, it also safeguards privacy. The platform has been instrumental in driving several research prototypes concerning document analysis such as the AI assistant utilized by University of California San Diegoâ€™s (UCSD) International Services and Engagement Office (ISEO).

## Installation
The simplest method to deploy DocMaster is to clone this repo and use the provided Docker Compose file.

1. First, clone this repo.  
`git clone git@github.com:alextongdo/doc-master.git`

2. Install Docker.  
`https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/`

4. Navigate to where you have cloned the Github repo and use the Docker Hub Compose file.  
`docker compose up`

### Platform Incompatibility
If you encounter any platform errors, a Compose file is provided that builds the images from scratch using this Github repository, which is a more stable method of installation for x86 platforms.

1. First, follow steps 1 and 2 from above.

2. Navigate to where you have cloned the Github repo and use the non Docker Hub Compose file.  
`docker compose -f docker-compose-no-hub.yml up`
