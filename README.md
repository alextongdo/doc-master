# DocMaster
DocMaster is a unified platform designed for annotating PDF documents, model training, and inference, tailored for document question-answering. Importantly, as annotations, training, and inference occur on-device, it also safeguards privacy. The platform has been instrumental in driving several research prototypes concerning document analysis such as the AI assistant utilized by University of California San Diegoâ€™s (UCSD) International Services and Engagement Office (ISEO).
